ABSTRACT = {Context: YOLO (You Look Only Once) is an algorithm based on deep neural networks with real-time object detection capabilities. This state-of-the-art technology is widely available, mainly due to its speed and precision. Since its conception, YOLO has been applied to detect and recognize traffic signs, pedestrians, traffic lights, vehicles, and so on. Objective: The goal of this research is to systematically analyze the YOLO object detection algorithm, applied to traffic sign detection and recognition systems, from five relevant aspects of this technology: applications, datasets, metrics, hardware, and challenges. Method: This study performs a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies on traffic sign detection and recognition using YOLO published in the years 2016–2022. Results: The search found 115 primary studies relevant to the goal of this research. After analyzing these investigations, the following relevant results were obtained. The most common applications of YOLO in this field are vehicular security and intelligent and autonomous vehicles. The majority of the sign datasets used to train, test, and validate YOLO-based systems are publicly available, with an emphasis on datasets from Germany and China. It has also been discovered that most works present sophisticated detection, classification, and processing speed metrics for traffic sign detection and recognition systems by using the different versions of YOLO. In addition, the most popular desktop data processing hardwares are Nvidia RTX 2080 and Titan Tesla V100 and, in the case of embedded or mobile GPU platforms, Jetson Xavier NX. Finally, seven relevant challenges that these systems face when operating in real road conditions have been identified. With this in mind, research has been reclassified to address these challenges in each case. Conclusions: This SLR is the most relevant and current work in the field of technology development applied to the detection and recognition of traffic signs using YOLO. In addition, insights are provided about future work that could be conducted to improve the field.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a traffic sign detection algorithm using improved lightweight YOLOv4 in order to solve the problems of large parameters quantity, poor real-time performance, and low accuracy for the unmanned driving system. Firstly, we use the MobileNetV2 network to replace the original feature extraction network in YOLOv4 to improve the detection speed by reducing the number of model parameters. Secondly, we add an attention mechanism to the backbone network to effectively extract feature information. Trim the network layer of the prediction part and add residual structure, so that feature reuse enhancement can avoid the gradient disappearing when the network layer is deeper. The size of the improved network model is reduced by 79.5%. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the network model is 2.5% lower than that of the YOLOV4 network, and the detection speed is 58.8% higher than that of the YOLOv4 network.}

ABSTRACT = {Traffic sign detection is a crucial task in computer vision, finding wide-ranging applications in intelligent transportation systems, autonomous driving, and traffic safety. However, due to the complexity and variability of traffic environments and the small size of traffic signs, detecting small traffic signs in real-world scenes remains a challenging problem. In order to improve the recognition of road traffic signs, this paper proposes a small object detection algorithm for traffic signs based on the improved YOLOv7. First, the small target detection layer in the neck region was added to augment the detection capability for small traffic sign targets. Simultaneously, the integration of self-attention and convolutional mix modules (ACmix) was applied to the newly added small target detection layer, enabling the capture of additional feature information through the convolutional and self-attention channels within ACmix. Furthermore, the feature extraction capability of the convolution modules was enhanced by replacing the regular convolution modules in the neck layer with omni-dimensional dynamic convolution (ODConv). To further enhance the accuracy of small target detection, the normalized Gaussian Wasserstein distance (NWD) metric was introduced to mitigate the sensitivity to minor positional deviations of small objects. The experimental results on the challenging public dataset TT100K demonstrate that the SANO-YOLOv7 algorithm achieved an 88.7% mAP@0.5, outperforming the baseline model YOLOv7 by 5.3%.},

    ABSTRACT = {The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique has achieved astonishing progress over the last few decades and has generated considerable interest in the autonomous driving community. With its conceptual roots in navigation and mapping, SLAM outperforms some traditional positioning and localization techniques since it can support more reliable and robust localization, planning, and controlling to meet some key criteria for autonomous driving. In this study the authors first give an overview of the different SLAM implementation approaches and then discuss the applications of SLAM for autonomous driving with respect to different driving scenarios, vehicle system components and the characteristics of the SLAM approaches. The authors then discuss some challenging issues and current solutions when applying SLAM for autonomous driving. Some quantitative quality analysis means to evaluate the characteristics and performance of SLAM systems and to monitor the risk in SLAM estimation are reviewed. In addition, this study describes a real-world road test to demonstrate a multi-sensor-based modernized SLAM procedure for autonomous driving. The numerical results show that a high-precision 3D point cloud map can be generated by the SLAM procedure with the integration of Lidar and GNSS/INS. Online four&ndash;five cm accuracy localization solution can be achieved based on this pre-generated map and online Lidar scan matching with a tightly fused inertial system.},

    abstract = { Data-hungry applications are central to the largest online platforms. Using a novel approach that leverages data science to inform the economics, we demonstrate how data is a source of market power. We highlight the importance of data heterogeneity, whereby small feature differences translate into large value differences. We examine how concept drift, the existence of a nonstationary relationship between the predictive and target variables, implies that access to a continuous stream of data is competitively advantageous. We analyze how an information bottleneck and high sample complexity in existing applications lead to increasing returns to data. Finally, we show how user interaction control enables personalization that raises switching costs. The combined effect is a potent data barrier to entry that endows substantial market power to only the largest online platforms. Competition policy should focus on enabling entrants unfettered access to vast continuous data streams similar to those available to platform incumbents. }

abstract = {We review the results of six forecasting competitions based on the online data science platform Kaggle, which have been largely overlooked by the forecasting community. In contrast to the M competitions, the competitions reviewed in this study feature daily and weekly time series with exogenous variables, business hierarchy information, or both. Furthermore, the Kaggle data sets all exhibit higher entropy than the M3 and M4 competitions, and they are intermittent. In this review, we confirm the conclusion of the M4 competition that ensemble models using cross-learning tend to outperform local time series models and that gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks are strong forecast methods. Moreover, we present insights regarding the use of external information and validation strategies, and discuss the impacts of data characteristics on the choice of statistics or machine learning methods. Based on these insights, we construct nine ex-ante hypotheses for the outcome of the M5 competition to allow empirical validation of our findings.}

	abstract = {The twenty-ﬁrst century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy, in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights and potential, has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new ﬁeld of data science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase, signiﬁcant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession and competency of data education, and the future of data science. This article is the ﬁrst in the ﬁeld to draw a comprehensive big picture, in addition to offering rich observations, lessons and thinking about data science and analytics.},
